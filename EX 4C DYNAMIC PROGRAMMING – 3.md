## AIM:
Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it.


## Algorithm
1.Initialize the DP table: Create a 2D table dp[n][n] where n is the length of the sequence, and initialize each dp[i][i] = 1 (single characters are palindromes of length 1).

2.Fill the DP table: For each pair of indices (i, j), if sequence[i] == sequence[j], set dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2; otherwise, set dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]).

3.Iterate over subsequences: Loop through subsequences of increasing lengths to fill the DP table.

4.Track the longest length: The value at dp[0][n-1] holds the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

5.Return the length: Return the value stored in dp[0][n-1], which is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.

        return dp[n1][n2]
    else:
        dp[n1][n2] = max(lps(s1, s2, n1 - 1, n2), lps(s1, s2, n1, n2 - 1))
